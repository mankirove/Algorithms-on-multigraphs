# Algorithms-on-multigraphs
In this project the program that calculates the size of a multigraph, Hamming distance between 2 multigrpahs , maximum clique of a multigraph using  Bronâ€“Kerbosch Algorithm  and maximum common subgraph of two (or more) given multigraphs  were prepared. In the report file you can find the complexity of the algorithms and detailed description.
